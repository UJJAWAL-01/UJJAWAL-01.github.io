  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <ul class="timeline">
    <li>
      <div class="role">Business Analyst Intern</div>
      <div class="org">ESPS Finserv Pvt. Ltd.</div>
      <div class="time">Jan 2025 – Jun 2025</div>
      <p>
        At ESPS Finserv, I worked on building an integrated investment product catalog that helped advisors 
        recommend more balanced portfolios to clients. By designing this catalog in Excel and applying 
        financial modeling techniques, I enabled about 40% of client portfolios to become more diversified.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I also developed algorithmic trading indicators in Python and Pine Script to support derivatives trading. 
        These strategies, combined with risk management protocols, reduced manual research time by almost an 
        hour per analysis and provided much more accurate trade signals.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond this, I researched statistical arbitrage algorithms for correlated securities. The models 
        automated long/short decisions based on price gaps, boosting profitability by nearly 20%. This role 
        gave me a solid foundation in quantitative trading, data-driven finance, and client portfolio analytics.  
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div class="role">Forensic Analyst Intern</div>
      <div class="org">DeepCytes Cyberlabs (UK)</div>
      <div class="time">Jun 2024 – Dec 2024</div>
      <p>
        As part of the forensics team, I contributed to the development of an integrated toolkit for 
        digital bug detection. Using bash scripting and process automation, I improved investigation 
        efficiency by 35% and established structured documentation to make the process repeatable and secure.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I also created detailed counter-surveillance techniques and checklists that field teams could use 
        during site evaluations. This included authoring a practical manual for using specialized 
        counter-surveillance tools.  
      </p>
      <p>
        A key highlight was designing and prototyping a hardware solution to defend against juice-jacking 
        attacks. This project involved extensive research, hardware testing, and collaboration with stakeholders. 
        The final field-ready prototype was successfully deployed, significantly enhancing mobile device security 
        in sensitive environments.  
      </p>

      <div class="role">Application Developer Intern</div>
      <div class="org">K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering</div>
      <div class="time">Jan 2023 – Mar 2023</div>
      <p>
        During this internship, I joined the department’s initiative to build the “Medical Information Collector” 
        (MIC) app — a platform aimed at redistributing unused medicines to communities in need.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I programmed the core application using Android Studio, implementing features that allowed users to 
        log, track, and organize leftover medicines for collection. I also contributed to the front-end design 
        by creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces in Figma, making the application accessible even to 
        first-time users.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This project taught me how to align technical development with social impact, while deepening my 
        knowledge of mobile app architecture, XML layouts, and user experience design.  
      </p>
